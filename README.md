# Hi there, welcome 👋

My name is **Nicolas Carlo** and I help people build maintainable softwares!

## About me

I live in Montréal (Canada 🍁) and I'm a Freelance Web Developer specialized in legacy codebases.

I'm *really* into community events 🍻 I organize the [Software Crafters](https://guild.host/software-crafters-montreal/events) and the [React](https://guild.host/react-montreal/events) Montréal guilds. I also give a hand to other local communities, such as the [TypeScript](https://guild.host/typescript-montreal/events) and [Elixir](https://guild.host/elixir-montreal/events) ones. In the past, I've also organized [The Legacy of SoCraTes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0M37QolwmwobAY4Bt8Tszg) & [SoCraTes Canada](https://socrates-ca.github.io/) conferences. I give talks too!

I frequently share advice to help you deal with **Legacy Code** on my blog [Understand Legacy Code](http://understandlegacycode.com). I even published a book to share the techniques that work best: [Legacy Code: First Aid Kit](https://understandlegacycode.com/first-aid-kit) ⛑

I'm the author of [Abracadabra, a VS Code extension for intuitive JS/TS refactorings](https://github.com/nicoespeon/abracadabra) 🔮

# Hi there, welcome 👋

My name is **Nicolas Carlo** and I help people build maintainable softwares!

## About me

I live in Montréal (Canada 🍁) and I'm a Freelance Web Developer specialized in legacy codebases.

I'm really into community events 🍻 and I organize the [Software Crafters](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Software-Crafters-Montreal/), [React](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/react-mtl/), and [TypeScript](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/typescript-montreal/) meetups in Montréal. I'm also the organizer of [The Legacy of SoCraTes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0M37QolwmwobAY4Bt8Tszg) conferences. I give talks too!

I frequently share advice to help you deal with **Legacy Code** on my blog [Understand Legacy Code](http://understandlegacycode.com). I even published a book to share the techniques that work best: [Legacy Code: First Aid Kit](https://understandlegacycode.com/first-aid-kit) ⛑

I'm the author of [Abracadabra, a VS Code extension for intuitive JS/TS refactorings](https://github.com/nicoespeon/abracadabra) 🔮
